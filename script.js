pseudo code: 
1. Get a deck of 52 cards
2. Shuffle the deck
3. Split the cards between 2 players

Rounds:

1. if player 1 or player 2 has 0 cards, they lose otherwise each player draws 1 cards
2. check to see if the cards have equal value. If player 1 or player two has less then 3 cards, they lose. Otherwise 
each player sets aside 3 cards and they go back to step 1.
3. The player with the higest value gets all the cards.The cards compiled are set aside.
4. repeat from step 1 */
